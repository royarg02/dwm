.SH NAME
dwm \- dynamic window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocle,
deck and floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimising
the environment for the application in use and the task performed.
.P
In tiled layouts windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area on the left contains one window by default, and the stacking area on the
right contains all other windows. The number of master area windows can be
adjusted from zero to an arbitrary number. In monocle layout all windows are
maximised to the screen size. In deck layout only the windows in the stacking
area follow the monocle layout; the master client is still visible. In floating
layout windows can be resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always
managed floating, regardless of the layout applied.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
Each screen contains two small status bars.
.P
One bar displays all available tags, the layout, the title of the focused
window, and the text read from the root window name property, if the screen is
focused. A floating window is indicated with an empty square and a maximised
floating window is indicated with a filled square before the windows title.  The
selected tags are indicated with a different color. The tags of the focused
window are indicated with a filled square in the top left corner.  The tags
which are applied to one or more windows are indicated with an empty square in
the top left corner.
.P
Another bar contains a tab for each window of the current view and allows
navigation between windows, especially in the monocle mode. The different
display modes of this bar are described under the Mod\-w Keybord command
section.  When a single tag is selected, this tag is indicated in the left corner
of the tab bar.
.P
dwm draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
dwm is customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
.P
Some options can be alternatively customized through
.B Xresources
with
.B dwm
prefix. See the source code for which settings can be provided through this
method.

.SH ISSUES
Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows
only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early
JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. Possible workarounds
are using JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or setting the
environment variable
.BR AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
(to use the older Motif backend instead) or running
.B xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set _NET_WM_NAME LG3D
or
.B wmname LG3D
(to pretend that a non-reparenting window manager is running that the
XToolkit/XAWT backend can recognize) or when using OpenJDK setting the environment variable
.BR _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 .
